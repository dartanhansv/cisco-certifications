# IPsec and Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI)

## Overview

Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI) simplifies IPsec tunnel configurations and improves interoperability.

### **Key Features**:

- Designed for **smaller deployments and hub-and-spoke topologies**.
- Replaces traditional cryptographic map-based configurations.
- Behaves like other tunnel interfaces (e.g., GRE, IPIP).
- Uses **IPsec ESP or AH** for encapsulation.

### **Advantages**:

- Provides a **routable interface** for terminating IPsec tunnels.
- Supports **standard-based IPsec interoperability**.
- The interface state depends on **IPsec Security Associations (SAs)**.

# Additional VPN Technologies

## Dynamic VTI, GET VPN, SSL VPN, and FlexVPN

### **Dynamic VTI**

- Supports dynamically created tunnels, reducing static configurations.

### **GET VPN (Group Encrypted Transport VPN)**

- Provides encryption without the need for individual tunnels.
- Uses **Key Servers** to distribute security policies.

### **SSL VPN**

- Allows secure access through web browsers.
- Works over **TLS/SSL** instead of traditional IPsec.

### **FlexVPN**

- Unified framework for **remote access, site-to-site, and DMVPN**.
- Uses **IKEv2** for enhanced security and scalability.
