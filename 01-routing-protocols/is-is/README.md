## ðŸ“š Table of Contents
- [IS-IS Overview](isis-overview.md): General introduction and key features of IS-IS.  
- [IS-IS NET Addressing](isis-net-addressing.md): Explanation of NET addressing and examples.  
- [IS-IS IPv6 Deployment](isis-ipv6-deployment.md): Details on IS-IS functionality in IPv6 environments.

## ðŸš¦ Study Tips

- Focus on how L1, L2, and L1/L2 routers interactâ€”this is critical for design scenarios.
- Understand the role of route leaking and up/down bits to support advanced services like MPLS VPNs.
- Remember that IS-IS has no concept of an Area 0; L2 adjacencies form the backbone dynamically.
- For IPv6, note that IS-IS treats address families separately and does not require a separate protocol version.
