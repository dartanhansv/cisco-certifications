# IS-IS IPv6 Deployment: Single vs. Multi-Topology and the Transition Feature

## Introduction
Integrated IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) supports both **IPv4 and IPv6** routing within the same protocol. When deploying IPv6 on an existing IPv4 IS-IS network, engineers must decide between **single-topology** and **multi-topology** designs. Additionally, the **transition feature** plays a key role in gradual IPv6 adoption.  
This summary explains these concepts and when to use each approach.

## IS-IS Single vs. Multi-Topology

### **1. Single-Topology IS-IS**
- **IPv4 and IPv6 share the same topology.**
- All IS-IS routers must support both IPv4 and IPv6.
- IPv6 routes follow the same IS-IS paths as IPv4.
- Uses **a single IS-IS Link-State Database (LSDB)**.
- More efficient, but requires **full IPv6 support** on all routers.

#### **When to Use Single-Topology IS-IS**
‚úÖ When all routers in the IS-IS domain support both IPv4 and IPv6.  
‚úÖ When IPv6 is expected to follow the same topology as IPv4.  
‚úÖ When minimizing overhead is a priority.

### **2. Multi-Topology IS-IS**
- **IPv4 and IPv6 have separate IS-IS topologies.**
- Some routers may run only IPv4 or only IPv6.
- IS-IS maintains **separate LSDBs** for IPv4 and IPv6.
- IPv4 and IPv6 routes can follow different paths.
- Requires more resources but allows for flexibility during migration.

#### **When to Use Multi-Topology IS-IS**
‚úÖ When IPv6 deployment is **incomplete**, and some routers do not support IPv6.  
‚úÖ When IPv4 and IPv6 require different **routing policies** or topologies.  
‚úÖ When transitioning from an IPv4-only network to an IPv6-enabled one **without impacting IPv4 routing**.

## The Transition Feature in IS-IS

The **transition feature** is used **only in single-topology IS-IS** to ensure a smooth migration from IPv4 to dual-stack (IPv4/IPv6). It helps prevent issues when some routers in the network **do not yet support IPv6**.

### **How the Transition Feature Works**
- Allows IS-IS to **advertise IPv6 reachability** in a single-topology design.
- Prevents routers that **do not support IPv6** from black-holing IPv6 traffic.
- Ensures backward compatibility during incremental IPv6 deployment.
- Once all routers support IPv6, the transition feature is no longer needed.

#### **When to Use the Transition Feature**
‚úÖ When migrating from an **IPv4-only single-topology IS-IS** network to dual-stack.  
‚úÖ When **some routers do not yet support IPv6**, but you want a unified topology.  
‚úÖ To avoid breaking IPv4 routing during IPv6 deployment.  

#### **When NOT to Use the Transition Feature**
‚ùå If **all routers already support IPv6**‚Äîit is unnecessary.  
‚ùå If using **multi-topology IS-IS**, since IPv4 and IPv6 are already separated.  
‚ùå If the goal is to move from **single-topology to multi-topology**‚Äîthis feature is unrelated.

## Conclusion
- **Single-topology IS-IS** is more efficient but requires all routers to support IPv6.
- **Multi-topology IS-IS** allows independent IPv4 and IPv6 topologies and is useful for incremental deployments.
- **The transition feature** is only relevant in single-topology IS-IS when IPv6 is being gradually introduced and some routers do not yet support it.

Understanding these concepts ensures a smooth IPv6 deployment in IS-IS networks. üöÄ
