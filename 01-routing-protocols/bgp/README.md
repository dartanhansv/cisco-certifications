## ðŸš¦ Study Tips

- Focus on the path selection processâ€”this is often tested and critical to understand BGP behavior.
- Master the purpose and use of well-known, optional, and transitive attributes.
- Understand how communities and local policies influence routing decisions across AS boundaries.
- Remember that BGP is policy-based and does not rely on metrics like IGPs.
