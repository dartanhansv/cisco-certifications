# Load Sharing in Layer 3 Networks

Effective load sharing enhances network performance and resilience by distributing traffic across multiple links. Layer 3 designs can leverage routing protocols and hardware features to optimize traffic flow.

## IP Routing Protocols and Equal-Cost Load Balancing

- **Equal-Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)**: Most routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) support ECMP, allowing routers to use multiple paths with the same metric.
- **`maximum-paths` Command**: Controls the number of equal-cost paths a router can install in the routing table.
  - Default: 4
  - Maximum: 6

## Bandwidth Consistency

- **Design Principle**: Maintain consistent bandwidth across parallel links within the same layer (e.g., core or distribution) to ensure proper ECMP operation.
- **Bandwidth-Aware Protocols**: EIGRP supports unequal-cost load balancing using the `variance` feature.

## Hop-Based Routing Considerations

- **Hop Count-Based Protocols** (e.g., RIP): May balance traffic over unequal-bandwidth links if hop count is equal.
- **Pinhole Congestion**:
  - Occurs when traffic is distributed to slower links, causing congestion.
  - Leads to underutilization of higher-capacity links and increased packet loss.
  - Avoid by using consistent bandwidth or switching to more intelligent routing protocols.

## Cisco Switching Modes and Load Balancing Behavior

- **Process Switching**:
  - Handles each packet individually.
  - Provides per-packet load balancing.

- **Fast/Autonomous/Silicon/Optimum/Distributed/NetFlow Switching**:
  - Cache-based forwarding.
  - Provides per-destination load balancing (less granular).

## Summary

Designing Layer 3 networks for load sharing involves:
- Leveraging routing protocol features like ECMP and variance.
- Ensuring consistent link bandwidths.
- Understanding how different switching modes impact traffic distribution.

These techniques improve bandwidth utilization and reduce the impact of failures or congestion on specific links.
