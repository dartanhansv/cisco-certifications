## Route Redistribution

Redistribution allows routes learned by one routing protocol to be advertised into another. It is common in networks with protocol migrations or multiple domains.

### Key Concepts
- **Seed Metric:** Some protocols require a manual seed metric when redistributing (e.g., EIGRP, RIP).
- **Route Tagging:** Helps to prevent routing loops by marking routes.
- **Filtering:** Use route-maps, prefix-lists, or tags to control which routes are redistributed.

## Redistributing OSPF into BGP

### Behavior:
- By default, only OSPF internal routes (Intra- and Inter-area) are redistributed.
- To redistribute external or NSSA routes, explicit keywords are required.

### Keywords:
- `internal`: Intra-area + Inter-area
- `external`: External Type 5 routes
- `nssa-external`: NSSA Type 7 routes

### Example:
```bash
router bgp 65001
 redistribute ospf 1 match external
```

## Redistributing EIGRP into OSPF

### Behavior:
- Requires a metric to redistribute into EIGRP.
- OSPF uses Type 2 (E2) external routes by default.

### Example:
```bash
router ospf 1
 redistribute eigrp 100 metric-type 2
```

## Loop Prevention Techniques

Loop prevention is critical during redistribution.

### Methods:
- **Route Maps:** Filter or tag specific routes
- **Administrative Distance:** Adjust to prefer the right protocol
- **Prefix Lists:** Limit accepted or advertised routes
- **Tags:** Prevent re-advertising of routes back to the original protocol
