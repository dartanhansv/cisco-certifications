### Route Summarization

#### Introduction
This summary outlines the importance and strategies for **route summarization**, a technique that helps scale networks, improve routing efficiency, and reduce the overhead of maintaining detailed routing tables. Proper summarization simplifies network management and reduces convergence time.

#### Summarization
- **Importance**: Route summarization helps reduce route traffic, unnecessary computations, and network complexity, allowing the network to scale as the company grows.
- **IP Address Allocation**: Assign IP networks to permit summarization, ensuring multiple IP addresses share the same leftmost bits for effective routing decisions.

#### Design Recommendations:
- **Distribution Layer**: Configure route summarization at the distribution layer to advertise a single summary route to the core and beyond.
- **EIGRP and OSPF**: Summarization limits the number of peers EIGRP must query or the number of LSAs OSPF must process, speeding up rerouting.
- **Network Interfaces**: Summarize at the distribution layer for all interfaces pointing to the network core.
- **Layer 3 Links**: Perform summarization at the boundary where the distribution layer connects to the core, requiring Layer 3 links between distribution switches.
- **OSPF Stub Areas**: Use OSPF stub areas as a simpler form of summarization.
- **WAN and Remote Access**: Implement summarization at WAN connectivity and remote-access points toward the network core to reduce routing table size.
- **Passive Interfaces**: Use passive interfaces on access layer interfaces to prevent neighbor adjacencies through the access layer, ensuring summarized routes take precedence.
