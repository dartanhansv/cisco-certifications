# OSPF LSA Types

OSPF uses **Link-State Advertisements (LSAs)** to distribute routing information between routers. Different LSA types control **which routes are shared, where they're propagated, and how OSPF areas handle external information**.

## 1. Router LSA (Type 1)

- Generated by **every OSPF router** within an area.
- Describes **all** links/interfaces, neighbors, and cost within the area.
- Stays **inside the originating area**.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Fundamental for intra-area routing decisions.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** No inter-area propagation.


## 2. Network LSA (Type 2)

- Generated by the **Designated Router (DR)** on broadcast/multi-access networks.
- Lists **all routers** attached to the network.
- **Only stays within the area**, does **not** cross ABRs.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Used in Ethernet segments for better scalability.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** DR-generated, area-local only.


## 3. Summary LSA (Type 3)

- Generated by **ABRs (Area Border Routers)**.
- Advertises **inter-area routes** (from one area to another).
- Represents **aggregated routes** instead of detailed topology info.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Provides controlled inter-area routing.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** ABR-controlled, simplifies routing across areas.


## 4. ASBR Summary LSA (Type 4)

- Generated by **ABRs** to advertise **Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) locations**.
- Required for routers **outside the ASBR‚Äôs area** to reach redistributed routes.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Helps routers know how to reach an ASBR.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** Necessary for accessing external routes.


## 5. External LSA (Type 5)

- Generated by **ASBRs** when redistributing external routes (e.g., EIGRP, BGP, static).
- Advertises **non-OSPF networks** throughout the OSPF domain.
- Propagates **into all areas**, except stub/totally stubby areas.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Required for OSPF to learn external routes.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** Blocked in stub-type areas.


## 6. NSSA External LSA (Type 7)

- Generated by **ASBRs inside an NSSA**.
- Similar to **Type 5 LSAs**, but **contained within NSSA**.
- **Converted to Type 5 LSAs** when leaving the NSSA through the ABR.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Redistribution within an NSSA while preventing Type 5 LSAs.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** ASBR injects as Type 7 ‚Üí ABR converts to Type 5.


## üîë  OSPF LSA Type Sumamry
| **LSA Type**          | **Generated By**     | **Scope**                   | **Purpose**                                   | **Best-Fit Scenario**                   |
|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Router (Type 1)      | Every OSPF router  | Local area only            | Describes router links/interfaces           | Intra-area topology discovery         |
| Network (Type 2)     | DR on multi-access | Local area only            | Lists routers on broadcast networks        | Efficient multi-access communication  |
| Summary (Type 3)     | ABR                | Inter-area                 | Advertises reachable networks between areas | Controlled inter-area routing         |
| ASBR Summary (Type 4)| ABR                | Inter-area                 | Tells routers how to reach an ASBR         | Inter-area redistribution awareness   |
| External (Type 5)    | ASBR               | Throughout OSPF domain     | Injects external routes (EIGRP, BGP, etc.) | Non-OSPF route advertisement         |
| NSSA External (Type 7)| ASBR (NSSA only)   | NSSA (converted by ABR)    | Redistribution within NSSA                  | External routes inside NSSA           |
