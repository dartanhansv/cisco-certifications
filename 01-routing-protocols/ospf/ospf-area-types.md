# OSPF Area Types

OSPF has different area types to optimize routing efficiency and reduce resource consumption on routers.

## 1. Backbone Area (Area 0)

- The central hub in a multi-area OSPF topology.
- All other areas must connect directly (or virtually) to Area 0.
- Supports **LSA Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5**.
- Used as the **transit area** for routing between non-backbone areas.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Core of the network, ensuring full route propagation between areas.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** Full routing info in and out.

---

## 2. Standard Area (Non-Backbone, Non-Special)

- Also called a **regular area**.
- A non-backbone area that **does not block any LSA types**.
- Supports **LSA Types 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5**.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - When an area needs full OSPF information and is not part of the backbone.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** Full OSPF routes, just not the backbone.

---

## 3. Stub Area

- **Blocks LSA Type 5 (external routes)** from being received.
- Cannot contain an ASBR (Autonomous System Boundary Router) - no redistribution.
- Instead of external LSAs, the ABR injects a **default route (`0.0.0.0/0`)**.
- Supports **LSA Types 1, 2, and 3**.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Remote sites that don't need external routes but do need inter-area routes.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** No external routes in, just a default route for them.

---

## 4. Totally Stubby Area *(Cisco Proprietary)*

- Blocks **LSA Types 3, 4, and 5**.
- Receives only a **default route** (`0.0.0.0/0`) from the ABR.
- Further reduces routing table size compared to a stub area.
- Supports **LSA Types 1 and 2 only** (3 only for default route).
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Very limited remote branches with low-end routers that need only a single path to the rest of the network.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** Only default route in, nothing else.

---

## 5. Not So Stubby Area (NSSA)

- Allows redistribution of external routes into OSPF.
- The ASBR in the area injects routes as **Type 7 LSAs** (not Type 5).
- ABR converts **Type 7 LSAs to Type 5** LSAs to share with Area 0 and beyond.
- **Does not accept Type 5 LSAs** from other areas.
- **Default route is not injected automatically**, must be configured:
  
    ```
    area <area-id> nssa default-information-originate
    ```

- Supports **LSA Types 1, 2, 3, and 7**.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Remote sites that must **inject external routes** (e.g., from EIGRP) into OSPF but **should not learn external routes** from other areas.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** **External routes out**, but **none in**.

---

## 6. Totally NSSA *(Cisco Proprietary)*

- Further restricts routing information within an NSSA.
- Blocks **LSA Types 3, 4, and 5**, only allowing a **default route** from the ABR.
- Still allows local redistribution as Type 7 LSAs.
- ABR converts **Type 7 LSAs into Type 5 LSAs**.
- **Automatically injects a default route** (`0.0.0.0/0`) ‚Äî in Cisco IOS, but **may not be the default behavior on all platforms**.
- Supports **LSA Types 1, 2, 3 (default only), and 7**.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - Remote sites that **must advertise external routes** but should **only use a default route** to reach the rest of the network.
- üß† **Keep in mind:** **External out**, **only default route in**.
