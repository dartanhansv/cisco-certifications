# OSPF Route Types

OSPF classifies routes based on their origin and administrative preference, ensuring optimal routing decisions.

---

## 1. Intra-Area Routes (**O**)
- Routes that exist **within the same OSPF area**.
- Learned via **LSA Type 1 (Router LSA) and LSA Type 2 (Network LSA)**.
- **Most preferred routes** because OSPF assumes internal paths are the most reliable.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - When all routers belong to the same OSPF area, ensuring the shortest and most stable paths.

---

## 2. Inter-Area Routes (**O IA**)
- Routes that originate **from a different OSPF area**.
- Advertised by an **Area Border Router (ABR)** using **LSA Type 3 (Summary LSA)**.
- **Less preferred than intra-area routes** since they involve multiple areas.
- **Best-fit scenario:**
  - When routing between different OSPF areas while maintaining scalability and summarization.

---

## 3. External Routes (**O E1 & O E2**)
- Routes that come **from outside the OSPF domain** (e.g., redistributed from BGP, EIGRP, or static routes).
- Introduced into OSPF by an **Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR)** using **LSA Type 5 (External LSA)**.
- **Divided into two types:**

  **ðŸ”¹ E1 (O E1) - External Type 1:**
  - Cost includes both **OSPF metric + external metric from the ASBR**.
  - **Preferred when multiple ASBRs exist** because it reflects the entire path cost.

  **ðŸ”¹ E2 (O E2) - External Type 2 (Default for Redistribution):**
  - Cost remains **only the external metric from the ASBR**, ignoring internal OSPF costs.
  - **Preferred for stable, fixed-cost external paths**.

- **Best-fit scenarios:**
  - **E1:** When multiple ASBRs exist, ensuring the most accurate path selection.
  - **E2:** When external routes have fixed costs, simplifying OSPF decision-making.

## 4. NSSA External Routes (**O N1 & O N2**)
- Similar to external routes, but specific to **Not-So-Stubby Areas (NSSA)**.
- Generated by an **ASBR inside an NSSA** and advertised using **LSA Type 7 (NSSA External LSA)**.
- The **ABR converts Type 7 LSAs into Type 5 LSAs** before propagating them into other areas.
- **Divided into two types:**

  **ðŸ”¹ N1 (O N1) - NSSA External Type 1:**
  - Includes both the **OSPF metric + external metric**.
  - **Preferred over N2 because it accounts for OSPF path cost**.

  **ðŸ”¹ N2 (O N2) - NSSA External Type 2:**
  - Uses **only the external metric**, similar to O E2 routes.

- **Best-fit scenarios:**
  - **N1:** When an NSSA area has multiple exit points and requires accurate path selection.
  - **N2:** When a stable external cost is preferable, minimizing internal metric fluctuations.

## 5. OSPF Route Preference Order
When multiple OSPF routes exist for the same destination, OSPF prefers them in the following order:

| **Preference**          | **Route Type**       | **Code** | **Description**                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** (Most Preferred)  | Intra-Area Routes    | O        | Routes learned within the same OSPF area          |
| **2**                   | Inter-Area Routes    | O IA     | Routes learned from a different OSPF area via ABR |
| **3**                   | External Type 1      | O E1     | Includes both OSPF metric and external metric     |
| **4**                   | NSSA External Type 1 | O N1     | Similar to O E1, but redistributed inside an NSSA |
| **5**                   | External Type 2      | O E2     | Uses only external metric, ignoring OSPF costs    |
| **6** (Least Preferred) | NSSA External Type 2 | O N2     | Similar to O E2, but redistributed inside an NSSA |
