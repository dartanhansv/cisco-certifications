# EIGRP Design Considerations

EIGRP does not broadcast its routing table periodically, which minimizes network overhead. It is scalable, efficient, and a suitable choice for large networks ‚Äî even as a core routing protocol. Its simplicity and performance make it ideal for both LAN and WAN environments. However, as a Cisco-proprietary protocol, it is not interoperable with third-party routers.

EIGRP is preferred over RIP in all enterprise scenarios due to faster convergence, better scalability, and more robust feature support.

## üöÄ EIGRP Scaling Techniques

For networks exceeding 100 routers, specific scaling strategies become important to maintain stability and performance:

### üîÅ Hierarchical Topology with Route Summarization

- As network size grows, risks like instability and delayed convergence increase.
- For example, in networks with 500+ routers, EIGRP may degrade without proper hierarchy.
- Use structured designs with summarization to minimize routing overhead.

**Best Practices:**

- Implement hierarchical layers with clear aggregation and distribution boundaries.
- Summarize routes at key aggregation points to reduce query propagation and CPU load.

#### ‚ûï Multiple EIGRP Autonomous Systems

- Used to segment very large networks.
- Limits query scope to within a specific AS, improving scalability.
- Offers logical separation of network domains.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use carefully‚ÄîEIGRP routes between different ASes are considered *external* (AD 170) and may not be preferred unless explicitly managed.

### üåø EIGRP Stub Routers

Stub routing is commonly used in hub-and-spoke topologies, especially over WANs.

**Behavior:**

- Stub routers advertise only a limited set of routes (e.g., connected, summary, static) to their upstream (hub).
- They do *not* forward routes learned from other EIGRP neighbors.

**Advantages:**

- Reduces query traffic across slow WAN links.
- Conserves memory and CPU resources.
- Increases network stability in large or complex topologies.

**Disadvantage:**

- Stub routers cannot act as backup paths between hub sites.

## üñ•Ô∏è EIGRP in the Data Center

Design considerations for EIGRP in data center (DC) environments are similar to those in WAN design but adapted to DC-specific requirements:

### üîπ Subnet Summarization

- Summarizing subnets at the aggregation layer helps reduce the size of routing tables.
- Improves scalability and simplifies troubleshooting in complex DC networks.

### üîπ Default Route Advertisement

- Aggregation layer routers can advertise a default route into the access layer.
- Prevents the need to propagate the full routing table throughout the DC.
- Enhances security and simplifies routing logic in access-layer switches or routers.

These techniques help EIGRP remain scalable and efficient in the context of diverse, high-speed, service-rich data center environments.

## EIGRP Security Considerations

Designing secure EIGRP deployments is critical to protecting routing information and maintaining network integrity. Here are key techniques:

### EIGRP Authentication

To prevent unauthorized EIGRP routers from injecting routes or participating in the routing domain, EIGRP supports authentication using either:

- **MD5 authentication** (older, widely supported)
- **HMAC-SHA-256 authentication** (recommended for modern IOS versions)

#### Benefits:
- Ensures only trusted routers form neighbor relationships.
- Prevents EIGRP peering with rogue or misconfigured devices.

#### Configuration Notes:
- Authentication must match on both sides (key string, key ID, and algorithm).
- Configure under the interface, not in EIGRP router mode.

### Route Filtering

EIGRP supports several filtering mechanisms to control routing information:

#### Common techniques:
- **Distribute-lists** (with ACLs or prefix-lists): filter inbound or outbound updates.
- **Route maps**: allow more advanced matching and manipulation.
- **Offset-lists**: adjust metric values to influence path selection.

#### Design Uses:
- Limit route propagation between parts of the network.
- Enforce routing policy and protect against accidental leaks.
- Prevent unwanted or unstable routes from influencing topology.

### Limiting EIGRP Queries

Although already mentioned earlier in stub routers and hierarchy, **limiting query scope** is also a security measure ‚Äî containing the impact of instability.
