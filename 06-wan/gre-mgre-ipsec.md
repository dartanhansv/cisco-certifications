# GRE, mGRE, and IPsec

## Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)

GRE is a tunneling protocol used to encapsulate various network layer protocols over an IP network.

### **Key Features**:

- Supports **unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic**.
- Enables dynamic routing protocols (e.g., **OSPF, EIGRP, BGP**) over tunnels.
- Forms a **virtual point-to-point connection** between routers.
- Uses protocol number **47**.

### **Advantages**:

- Supports **multicast traffic**, enabling routing protocols.
- Allows deployment of any IGP over a GRE tunnel.

### **Disadvantages**:

- No built-in encryption; typically combined with **IPsec for security**.
- No native keepalive mechanism (Cisco provides a proprietary solution).
- Adds **24 bytes** of overhead, potentially leading to fragmentation issues.

### **Recursive Routing Loops**:

- Occur when the tunnel destination is routed through the tunnel itself.
- Prevent these loops by carefully managing **route filtering** and ensuring distinct routing domains for the transport network and GRE tunnel.

# Multipoint GRE (mGRE)

## Overview

mGRE enables a single GRE interface to support multiple tunnels, **reducing configuration complexity** in dynamic VPN environments.

### **Key Features**:

- Uses a **single GRE interface** to establish multiple tunnels.
- Supports **unicast, multicast, and broadcast** traffic.
- Relies on **Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)** for **dynamic peer discovery**.

### **Common Use Cases**:
- **DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint VPN)**: A scalable solution for enterprises managing branch office connectivity.
- **Large-Scale VPN Deployments**: mGRE simplifies configurations when multiple remote sites need secure connectivity.

# GRE Over IPsec

## Why Combine GRE and IPsec?

IPsec ensures **encryption**, but it does not allow **multicast or broadcast traffic** to pass through. This creates a challenge because **routing protocols rely on multicast to exchange updates**‚Äîand they can‚Äôt function properly within an IPsec-only tunnel.

**The solution? Wrap multicast-enabled GRE inside an IPsec tunnel.**  
- GRE enables **routing protocols** to work as expected.
- IPsec ensures **data confidentiality and integrity**.
- Together, they provide **secure and scalable VPN connectivity** for dynamic routing over encrypted tunnels.

### **Implementation Methods**:

1. **Cryptographic Maps**:
   - GRE packets are encrypted using an IPsec **crypto map**.
   - More complex but useful for multi-vendor environments.
   
2. **Tunnel Protection Mechanism** (**Recommended Approach**):
   - GRE encapsulation occurs first, followed by **automatic encryption via IPsec**.
   - Simplifies configuration, improves performance, and eliminates manual ACL management.
