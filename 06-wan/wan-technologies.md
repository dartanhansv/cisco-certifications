# WAN Technologies

Wide Area Networks (WANs) use a variety of technologies to connect geographically dispersed locations. Enterprises can choose from wired and wireless solutions based on bandwidth, scalability, cost, and performance needs.

This section covers Metro Ethernet, Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (DWDM), and Mobile Wireless (4G/5G) technologies.


## Metro Ethernet

- **Demand**: Increasing due to high throughput requirements of data-intensive applications.
- **Technology**: Uses Ethernet, IP, and optical technologies like DWDM and CWDM to deliver low-cost, high-speed MAN/WAN connectivity.
- **Services**: Offers converged network services (data, voice, video) on the same wire, providing enterprise LAN functionality in MAN and WAN.
- **Bandwidth**: Ranges from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps or higher, supporting high performance and QoS requirements.
- **Deployment**: Easier to deploy and scale due to flexible bandwidth increments.

### Benefits of Ethernet Handoffs at the Customer Edge

- **Service-Enabling Solution**: Adds value-added services to the network.
- **Flexible Architecture**: No need for truck rolls or new CPE, evolving WAN services to IP-based solutions.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easy integration with existing LAN network equipment.


## Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (DWDM)

- **Function**: Increases bandwidth capabilities of fiber by using different wavelengths of light (channels) over the same fiber strand.
- **Benefits**: Maximizes use of installed fiber, adds new bandwidth to existing channels, and supports various devices (IP routers, Ethernet switches, SONET terminals).

### Dark Fiber

- **Definition**: Fiber-optic cable installed in the ground with right-of-way issues.
- **Usage**: Allows enterprises to control services provided by the link, similar to leased-line circuits.
- **Design**: Requires signal regenerators for long distances, designs for high availability typically include multiple links. Unlike SONET/SDH technology, redundancy must be manually planned.



## Wireless Technology

Wireless communications use electromagnetic waves to transmit signals between endpoints.

### Mobile Wireless

- Consists of cellular applications and mobile phones, evolving toward faster digital services with 5G.
- **3GPP**: Standards body responsible for mobile technologies including 3G, 4G, and 5G.

### Mobile Technologies

- **GSM**: Digital mobile radio standard using TDMA technology in the 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz bands; supports international roaming with data rates up to 9600 bps.
- **GPRS**: Enhances GSM speeds up to 128 kbps.
- **UMTS**: Also known as 3G broadband; supports voice, video, and data with transmission rates up to 2.0 Mbps.
- **LTE**: 4G LTE, increasing capacity and speed with download peaks up to 300 Mbps and upload peaks up to 50 Mbps.
- **LTE Advanced**: Enhances LTE with carrier aggregation; download speeds up to 600 Mbps, upload up to 100 Mbps.
- **LTE Advanced Pro**: Pathway to 5G, offering up to 1.1 Gbps download and 200 Mbps upload.
- **5G**: The latest evolution, enabling download speeds up to 20 Gbps and upload speeds up to 10 Gbps with enhancements like carrier aggregation and sub-6 GHz spectrum use.
