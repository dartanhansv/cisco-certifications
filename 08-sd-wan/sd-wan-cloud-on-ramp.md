| **Enhanced App Performance** | Prioritizes critical apps like SaaS and cloud-hosted workloads.            |
| **Simplified Connectivity**  | Streamlines direct, secure access to cloud platforms.                      |
| **Improved Security**        | Integrates with on-prem or cloud-delivered security services (e.g., SASE). |
| **Cost Efficiency**          | Reduces dependency on expensive MPLS circuits through dynamic path usage.  |
| **Agility**                  | Speeds up deployment of cloud resources and app migration.                 |

### Challenges

| Challenge                      | Description                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network Visibility**         | Monitoring distributed SD-WAN paths can be complex.      |
| **Troubleshooting Complexity** | Debugging overlay issues requires new tools and skills.  |
| **Security Considerations**    | SD-WAN overlays require dedicated protection strategies. |
| **SLA Limitations**            | Not all dynamic routing scenarios meet strict SLA needs. |
