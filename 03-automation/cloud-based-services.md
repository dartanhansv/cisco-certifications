# Cloud Deployment Models


Cisco cloud-based services can be deployed across **private**, **public**, or **hybrid** cloud environments. Each deployment model aligns with one or more cloud service models, including:

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

Understanding these models is essential for designing **secure, scalable, and optimized SD-WAN connectivity** for cloud-hosted applications.

## Deployment Models

| Deployment Model  | Description                                                                                       | Example Cisco Services                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private Cloud** | Hosted within an organization‚Äôs own data center, offering maximum control, customization, and security. | **Cisco UCS Director**: Automates provisioning and management of data center infrastructure.                          |
| **Public Cloud**  | Hosted by providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud and accessed over the public internet.      | **Cisco Meraki**: Cloud-managed networking.<br>**Cisco Umbrella**: DNS-layer security and threat protection.         |
| **Hybrid Cloud**  | Integrates on-premises and cloud resources, allowing flexible workload placement, scalability, and disaster recovery. | **Cisco SD-WAN**: Enables dynamic routing between on-prem and cloud providers.<br>**Cisco HyperFlex**: Hyperconverged infrastructure with cloud extension capabilities. |

> Hybrid cloud models are particularly useful for **burst capacity handling**, **seamless workload migration**, and **secure interconnect between branch and cloud resources**.

## Key Takeaways
- **Private Cloud**: Best for high security, compliance-heavy workloads, and full control over infrastructure.
- **Public Cloud**: Ideal for scalable, cost-effective services with minimal infrastructure management.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Balances security, flexibility, and scalability, making it suitable for enterprises with dynamic workloads.
