# WAN Integration

## Introduction

**WAN Integration** enables seamless connectivity between an organization‚Äôs on-premises data center and cloud service providers. It typically leverages a **hybrid WAN architecture** that combines **MPLS** and **Internet circuits**, allowing for optimized routing, enhanced performance, and reduced costs compared to MPLS-only setups.
