## Cisco WAN Integration

Cisco provides WAN integration via its **SD-WAN** solutions, offering a software-defined, policy-driven approach to managing WAN traffic. The key benefits include cost savings, performance improvement, and security enhancements. However, organizations must plan for **infrastructure transition** and **system integration** when adopting this model.
