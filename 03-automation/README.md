# ðŸ¤– Automation and Programmability

Welcome! This folder contains summaries of my study notes related to **network automation and programmability**.

These notes are designed to help **Cisco certification candidates** by presenting structured, easy-to-digest material.

Automation plays a key role in **improving network efficiency, reducing manual configuration efforts, and enhancing scalability**. Understanding these concepts is essential for modern networking.
