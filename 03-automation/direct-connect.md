# Dedicated Cloud Connectivity

## Introduction

**Direct cloud connectivity** establishes a **private, dedicated link** between an enterprise‚Äôs on-premises infrastructure and a cloud provider‚Äôs network, bypassing the public internet. Common examples include **AWS Direct Connect** and **Azure ExpressRoute**.

A **hybrid WAN approach** may incorporate **MPLS Direct Connect**, where service providers deliver private cloud connectivity using **Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)** as part of a broader enterprise WAN architecture.

These solutions ensure **high-performance, secure, and reliable cloud access** while avoiding public internet exposure.
