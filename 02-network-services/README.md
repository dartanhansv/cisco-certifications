# 🌐 Network Services

This section covers critical services that ensure a scalable, resilient, and efficient enterprise network. Focus areas include QoS models and techniques for traffic management, as well as best practices for designing robust network management solutions.

## 📖 Topics Covered

- [QoS Models](qos-models.md)  
  Explore traditional and modern QoS models like Best-Effort, IntServ, and DiffServ, understanding how they prioritize and guarantee network traffic delivery.

- [QoS Policies](qos-policies.md)  
  Dive into the mechanisms behind traffic classification, shaping, policing, queuing strategies (like LLQ and WRR), and how QoS policies are applied end-to-end in enterprise environments.

- [QoS Trust Boundaries](qos-trust-boundaries.md)  
  Learn about trust boundaries at network edges, how ports handle trusted/untrusted traffic markings, and best practices to secure QoS markings against misuse.

- [Network Management](network-management.md)  
  Understand network management architectures (in-band vs. out-of-band), key processes (FCAPS), prioritization of management traffic, and the components that make enterprise monitoring possible.
