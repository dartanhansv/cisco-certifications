# QoS Models

Quality of Service (QoS) is essential for managing network resources and providing better application experiences. Cisco supports three main models for QoS service differentiation: Best-Effort (BE), Differentiated Services (DiffServ), and Integrated Services (IntServ).

## ðŸš€ Best-Effort QoS
- **Default Model**: No QoS behaviors to prioritize traffic.
- **Usage**: Not suitable for real-time applications like voice or video; used after prioritizing other important traffic classes.

## ðŸš€ Integrated Services (IntServ)
- **Real-Time Applications**: Designed for video, multimedia conferencing, and virtual reality.
- **Resource Reservation**: Uses RSVP to request QoS along the end-to-end path.
- **Functions**: Admission control, classification, policing, queuing, and scheduling.
- **Guarantees**: Provides hard QoS guarantees like bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rates end-to-end.

## ðŸš€ Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
- **Traffic Classes**: Separates traffic into multiple classes to meet varying QoS requirements.
- **Packet Marking**: Uses DSCP values to classify and prioritize traffic.
- **Scalability**: Designed to overcome IntServ limitations, providing cost-effective and scalable QoS.
- **Per-Hop Behavior (PHB)**: Defined by DSCP settings or ACLs, ensuring proper treatment across the network.
