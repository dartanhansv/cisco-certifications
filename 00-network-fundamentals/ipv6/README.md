# IPv6 Study Notes

Welcome to the **IPv6** section!

This directory compiles essential concepts, design considerations, and deployment strategies for IPv6. Whether you're preparing for certification exams or modernizing your network architecture, these summaries aim to simplify your transition from IPv4 and strengthen your confidence in dual-stack or native IPv6 environments.

## ðŸš¦ Study Tips

- IPv6 isnâ€™t just more addressesâ€”understand how its design impacts routing, security, and mobility.
- Know the migration techniques well; this is a common exam and real-world planning topic.
- Subnetting in IPv6 is simpler once you grasp hexadecimal math and prefix boundaries.
- Focus on address planning models (e.g., SLAAC vs DHCPv6) to support scalable enterprise deployments.
