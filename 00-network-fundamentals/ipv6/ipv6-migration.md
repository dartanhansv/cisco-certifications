# IPv6 Migration Strategies

Transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 is essential due to IPv4 address exhaustion and the growing demand for scalable networks. IPv6 migration strategies aim to introduce IPv6 while maintaining interoperability with existing IPv4 infrastructure, ensuring a seamless transition based on business, technical, and operational needs.

---

## üîÄ Core IPv6 Migration Strategies

Organizations adopt one of three primary strategies for IPv6 migration:

* **Dual-stack**: Hosts and networks run IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
* **Tunneling**: IPv6 traffic is encapsulated within IPv4 packets for transport across an IPv4-only infrastructure.
* **Translation**: IPv6 packets are translated into IPv4 and vice versa, enabling communication between native-only hosts.

These strategies help ensure continued connectivity while integrating IPv6.

## üß± IPv6 Deployment Models

Deployment models define how IPv6 is introduced within networks:

* **Dual-stack model**: IPv4 and IPv6 coexist on hosts and network devices, maintaining separate routing and management.
* **Hybrid model**: Mixes tunneling (e.g., ISATAP, manual tunnels) and dual-stack techniques to extend IPv6 into an IPv4 core.
* **Service block model**: Uses tunneling technologies to provide IPv6 connectivity for a specific module or service block.

> **Note:** The dual-stack model is preferred due to its simplicity and the elimination of tunneling overhead.

| Deployment Model               | Advantages                                                           | Disadvantages                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dual-stack**                 | - No tunneling required<br>- Independent IPv4/IPv6 policies          | - Requires network equipment upgrades                  |
| **Hybrid with ISATAP tunnels** | - Leverages existing infrastructure<br>- No upgrades needed          | - No IPv6 multicast support                            |
| **Hybrid with manual tunnels** | - Maintains independent IPv4 and IPv6 policies                       | - High operational overhead due to many static tunnels |
| **Service block model**        | - Lower impact on existing network<br>- Flexible IPv6 access control | - Requires additional tunneling and equipment          |

### Model Summary

* **Dual-stack model**: Full coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 on all routers and hosts.
* **Hybrid model**: Tunnels IPv6 traffic over IPv4 while allowing dual-stack clients and servers.
* **Service block model**: Provides IPv6 in isolated sections of the network.

## üåê Dual-Stack Migration Strategy

Dual-stack (native mode) allows devices to communicate over both IPv4 and IPv6, using the appropriate stack for each connection.

* **DNS Behavior**:

  * AAAA record ‚Üí IPv6 stack used
  * A record ‚Üí IPv4 stack used

Since major operating systems prioritize IPv6, this strategy supports a smooth, phased migration.

## üï≥Ô∏è IPv6 over IPv4 Tunneling Strategy

Tunneling enables IPv6 networks to communicate across an IPv4 backbone by encapsulating IPv6 packets within IPv4 frames.

* **Tunnel endpoints must support both IPv4 and IPv6.**
* **Common use cases**: Border-to-border or border-to-host tunneling.
* **Drawback**: Encapsulation increases overhead, reducing MTU by 20 bytes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Tunnels & GRE

* **Manual tunnels** (RFC 4213): Configured with fixed IPv4/IPv6 endpoints.
* **GRE tunnels**: Support IPv6 and other L3 protocols like IS-IS.

---

## üîÑ Automatic Tunnel Mechanisms

### 6to4 (RFC 3056)

* Uses prefix `2002::/16`
* Embeds IPv4 address in IPv6 format
* Border routers forward encapsulated IPv6 packets over IPv4

### 6RD (RFC 5969)

* ISP variant of 6to4 using provider-assigned IPv6 prefixes
* Requires a 6RD Border Relay (BR) router for handling IPv6 traffic

### ISATAP

* Enables intra-site tunneling for IPv6 traffic within IPv4 networks
* Addresses follow format: `prefix:0000:5EFE:IPv4-addr`
* Example: `FE80::5EFE:C0A8:0A0A` (for 192.168.10.10)

---

## üîÅ IPv6/IPv4 Translation Strategy

Translation mechanisms allow IPv6-only hosts to communicate with IPv4-only hosts, eliminating the need for dual-stack.

### üîß DNS64 (RFC 6147)

* Synthesizes AAAA records from A records.
* Enables IPv6 clients to connect to IPv4 servers using domain names.
* Works with NAT64 gateways for full translation.

---

## üîÉ NAT64

Combined with DNS64, NAT64 enables communication between IPv6-only and IPv4-only devices. It facilitates translation between different IP versions and is a key tool in IPv6 migration strategies.

### Supported Communication Scenarios

* **IPv6-only clients ‚Üí IPv4-only servers** (common, works with stateful or stateless NAT64 depending on the use case)
* **IPv4-only clients ‚Üí IPv6-only servers** (only possible with stateless NAT64 and static mappings)

### Types of NAT64 Translation

#### Stateful NAT64

Works similarly to IPv4 NAT overload (PAT), but translates between IPv6 and IPv4.

* Conserves IPv4 address space via N:1 bindings between multiple IPv6 addresses/ports and one (or more) IPv4 address/ports.
* Maintains session state, which allows dynamic mapping but breaks end-to-end transparency.
* Typically used when IPv6 hosts initiate connections toward IPv4-only destinations.
* Offers flexibility in IPv6 address assignment: manual, DHCPv6, or SLAAC.

üìå **Use cases**:

* ISPs or enterprises migrating to IPv6 while supporting access to legacy IPv4-only resources.
* Scenarios where many IPv6 hosts need access to a limited IPv4 pool.

#### Stateless NAT64

Performs 1:1 translation between IPv6 and IPv4 addresses ‚Äî no address overloading.

* Does not maintain state, preserving end-to-end transparency between hosts.
* Requires that IPv6 hosts use IPv4-convertible IPv6 addresses, such as those following RFC 6052 format.
* IPv6 addresses must be manually configured or assigned via DHCPv6 (SLAAC not supported).

üìå **Use cases**:

* IPv6-only servers that need to be accessible by IPv4-only clients.
* Networks where address transparency and traceability are required.
* Scenarios with a small number of IPv6 hosts needing static IPv4 reachability.
