### SD-Access Overview

**Focus**: Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) is Cisco‚Äôs enterprise campus solution within the Cisco DNA framework. It replaces traditional campus LAN design with intent-based networking to automate, segment, and secure wired and wireless access networks.

**Enablement**: SD-Access is delivered via the Cisco DNA Center, which provides centralized design, provisioning, policy enforcement, and assurance capabilities.

#### üöÄ Benefits of SD-Access
- **Automation**: Streamlines network provisioning, configuration, and management across wired and wireless infrastructure.
- **Policy**: Implements scalable, group-based security and segmentation policies automatically.
- **Assurance**: Offers real-time visibility, predictive analytics, and proactive troubleshooting.
- **Integration**: Extends functionality through open APIs and integration with third-party solutions.

#### üß† Cisco DNA Center Functional Pillars
- **Design**: Logical and physical topology creation, IP address planning.
- **Policy**: Intent-based access control using group-based policies.
- **Provision**: Automated deployment of wired/wireless devices into fabric domains.
- **Assurance**: Continuous health monitoring, AI/ML-based insights, and user/device analytics.

#### üèóÔ∏è SD-Access Fabric Components
The SD-Access fabric includes the network infrastructure that supports the following layers:

- **Underlay**: Physical routing infrastructure (Layer 3) that provides IP reachability.
- **Overlay**: VXLAN-based logical topology that abstracts physical paths and enables scalable segmentation.
- **Control Plane**: LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol) used for host location mapping and traffic forwarding decisions.
- **Data Plane**: VXLAN encapsulation and transport for user traffic between fabric nodes.

#### üîå Key Elements of Cisco SD-Access
- **Cisco DNA Center**: Orchestration and management platform for fabric automation and assurance.
- **Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)**: Centralized policy engine for identity-based access control and segmentation.
- **Cisco DNA Software**: Software tier that enables SD-Access functionality (automation, security, assurance).
- **Wireless Infrastructure**: Includes Wi-Fi 6 APs and controllers, unified into the SD-Access fabric.
- **Switches and Routers**: Fabric-enabled infrastructure capable of supporting VXLAN and LISP.
- **Services**: Cisco offers professional services like SD-Access Advise & Implement to accelerate adoption.
